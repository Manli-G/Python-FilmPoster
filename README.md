# Python-FilmPoster

### 1.Why I choose “Black Mirror” as my poster theme? 

Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. It examines modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. It is a series of dramas. In fact, I would rather say that it is an independent film with different themes, different characters and different relationships. I choose it because base on big internet environment, some are happening or imminent, it need us to think more about.

### 2. What ideas generate when designing the poster?

From overall view, the poster consist of kind of shapes, the reason why I using shape and line because geometry is rational and represents the reality of the Internet, and a rational theme that fits into technology.

The background are blocks interweaving together, which metaphors rule, this rule could be any thing depending perspective. As audience notice, the sharp triangle just like the sharp and broken mirror, which reflective human nature, represent dangerous as well, and it insert the “rule”  from top to bottom. The technique in some way can destroy the human rule, which is what I want to expressing in this poster.

### 3. What Principles of Design I have used in this poster?
Balance 
Proximity 
Alignment
Unity

According the element that I have used in the poster, that combine with the concept of theme.

Emphasis

What I emphasis is what audience first notice at first glance.The “mirror” from size,  shape and colour to catch audiences eyes. And the mirror reflecting the close-up of plot, which full of emotional feeling compare with the “rule” rational, thereby form the visual shock.

### 4. How I achieve this effect by scripting?

During the scripting I was happen the some problems, for instance, the image import into layer with black background. After I save the image format from “jpg” to “png” to solve the picture background as transparent, still existing this issue, at first thought is I should change the layer where current image on the background as transparency, or setting the opacity, but I found the opacity value will applied in whole layer includes the image, finally I edit the “RGB_IMAGE” to “RGBA_IMAGE” solved this problem.
